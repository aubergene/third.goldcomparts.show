        The exhibition presents a collection of assemblages we’ve cultivated
        under the extraordinary and global conditions of these troubled months.
        Fantastic fusions of technology, ideas, humans and other creatures,
        these works have emerged, flourishing, from a twisted reality of seismic
        chaos and confusion.

        The Goldsmiths MA/MFA in Computational Art invites you to step into
        Chimera Garden and walk among the collection of assemblages we’ve
        cultivated under the extraordinary conditions of these troubled months.
        Fantastic fusions of technology, ideas, humans and other creatures,
        these works have emerged, flourishing, from a twisted reality of seismic
        chaos and confusion. In our current place of epochal chaos and
        transformation, the foundations on which we’ve built the seemingly
        monolithic and unquestionable have been disturbed. We are not on solid
        ground, but we never really were. Exposed fault lines have thrown
        societal inequalities and injustices into brutal relief, emitting new
        framings for old questions. At the same time, as individuals we’ve been
        distanced, physically and socially, into unique states of alienation.
        It’s a liminal space, where computation now mediates our lives in ways
        unseen just a few months ago. So as a cohort, we’re uniquely situated to
        re-imagine, to re-world - making new connections to each other and the
        world around us, building new possibilities of being.
