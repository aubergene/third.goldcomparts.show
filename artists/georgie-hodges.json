With the most recent developments being two student halls built on either side of Spa Park, both opposed almost 400 to 5.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of council homes have been demolished and replaced with unaffordable gated communities alienating residents who had not been entirely removed from the area. Following the introduction of Right to Buy back in the 80s, and the commentary curated around &quot;&quot;sink estates&quot;&quot;, council housing has been heavily stigmatised. The stigmatisation has been used to destroy, tear apart and displace communities from their homes.</p>\n<p>My piece &quot;&quot;Bermondsey Spa&quot;&quot; aims to begin to deconstruct and destigmatise council housing through exploring my connection with the area. Particularly over the last year where I've been shielding. Bermondsey Spa depicts the panoramic view I have from my windows, it shows private developments in contrast with council housing. Through poetry and illustration, this piece both explores my conflict with and romanticisation of Bermondsey Spa.</p>\n","events":[]}
