The training data, obtained from a personal archive, is processed through a context encoder to produce (curate) versions of a new exhibition format or speculative archival. However, the intention is not to reproduce yet another series of endless white cubes, or another 3D modelled digital gallery which are in abundance today. Instead, the project seeks to address the current disposable nature of art spaces, which are endlessly being overwritten by, or even erased by the productive logic of the city. Rather than presenting another computer generated digital composite of images describing a space, the work will strive against this averaging - and hence commodification of space - by reforming their connections to their built environment. The composited spaces will hence be rendered in 3D, where the images are mapped as though frames of a video gallery walkthrough were spliced and repositioned to track camera movement. This will then be translated into a sculptural installation containing kinetic “browsing copies” of these machine generated art spaces. Through this, the project hopes to offer generative methods of producing spaces as a way of creating a counter consciousness that is more distributive but still rooted in a local culture and memory.</p>\n","events":[]}
