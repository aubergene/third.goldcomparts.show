Ambient, because I will emphasise tone and atmosphere, taking directly from ambient music. GAN, because I will train my styleGAN2 models to generate images and with these, latent space walk videos (interpolation videos). Living-Painting, because I will attempt to contain time by registering a stream of data from the organic world and giving it a life of its own in the digital one, even if this life is just an inaccurate and biased reflection of a moment that is no longer there, it will be a machineâ€™s unique vision of the natural world: a canvas in constant flux. I see this technique as an evolution of still-life painting and as a translation of the natural-organic world into the digital-silicon one.</p>\n","events":[]}
