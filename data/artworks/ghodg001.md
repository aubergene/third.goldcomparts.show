Architectural models and computer-generated images are often seen in regeneration plans, these often create an “idealistic” image whilst socially cleansing the areas by placing poorly edited in affluent professionals to make the area appear more “appealing”.

This piece aims to explore my connection with the Bermondsey Spa Development and how I've experienced gentrification through exploring the views from my window and telling the story of my area through this.
