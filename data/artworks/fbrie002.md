In The Order of Things, Foucault describes the four Similitudes believed to be the main principles of relation forming the connecting tissue of the world: 
Convenientia, Aemulatio, Analogia and Sympatheia.
These Similitudes inspired a series of computational representations, shifting and morphing behind the deforming glass domes mounted on four handcrafted wooden visualisers.
 
Forged  in a pocket of time intersecting past and future, these mystical, legendary items, invaluable instruments of divination and windows into the inner workings of the world, providing arcane visualisations of the fundamental laws governing the forces that tie together the fabric of all things, materialised in my garden one morning.
